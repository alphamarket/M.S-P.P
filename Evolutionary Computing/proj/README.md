# Learnable Evolution Model(LEM)

This is an implementation of origin [LEM algorithm](https://github.com/noise2/learnable-evolution-model/blob/master/doc/LEM.pdf).

> **Remark:** I have used neural network(NN) as my `hypothesis creator and instantizer`, surprisingly proved to be an effective instantizer for *Solving Equation Systems* and compared to the original test in the paper on the same problem, using NN had better results.
